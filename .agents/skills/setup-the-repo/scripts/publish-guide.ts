Merges to \`main\` publish alphas. A stable release is the manual **Release** workflow (Actions tab,
Run workflow, pick a bump): it publishes, then creates the \`vX.Y.Z\` tag and the GitHub release.
Never run \`npm publish\` locally after the first publish (see AGENTS.md).

## One-time setup

1. **Sign in to npm** on the machine you work from: \`npm login --auth-type=web\`. Open the printed
   URL within five minutes; on a headless machine run it as \`BROWSER=none npm login --auth-type=web\`.
   Verify with \`npm whoami\`.
2. ${scopeStep}
3. **Check the name is free**: \`npm view ${packageName}\` should answer 404.
4. **First publish, locally.** npm cannot attach a trusted publisher to a package that does not exist
   yet, so the maintainer publishes the first version by hand. Bump the version in the working tree
   only (never commit it), publish under the \`alpha\` tag without provenance (it needs CI), approve the
   2FA URL npm prints, then discard the bump:
   \`\`\`bash
   npm version 0.1.0-alpha.0 --no-git-tag-version
   npm publish --access public --tag alpha --provenance=false
   git checkout package.json
   \`\`\`
   Confirm with \`npm view ${packageName} dist-tags\`.
5. **Add the Trusted Publisher**: on npmjs.com open the package, then Settings, then Trusted Publisher,
   and choose GitHub Actions with repository \`${repoName}\`, workflow \`release.yml\`, **allow
   publish directly** (stage-only would queue every CI release for manual approval), and no
   environment name. The configuration must be validated by one successful CI publish within two
   days. Then set the package's publishing access to require 2FA and disallow tokens.
6. **Check release.yml**: it should be the thin caller of the shared workflow
   (\`uses: trajectonomics/cicd/.github/workflows/publish.yml@v1\`). npm validates the *calling*
   file, so keep it named \`release.yml\` and give it \`id-token: write\` and a \`workflow_dispatch\` \`bump\` input. A copy that still has the
   "Skipping publish step" guard exits green without publishing when \`NPM_TOKEN\` is missing.
7. **Verify**: merge a small \`fix:\` PR and confirm the new alpha appears with provenance.
   Cut the first stable with the Release workflow (\`bump = major\` gives \`1.0.0\`).

## What looks like a failure but is not

- **\`npm view\` says 404 right after a green publish.** The registry takes one to three minutes to
  show a new version, and \`dist-tags\` updates last. Trust the \`+ ${packageName}@X.Y.Z\` line in the
  CI log, then look again.
- **A \`0.0.0-stage\` version appears** after the first release: npm's staged publishing placeholder,
  not a failed release.
- **A stable run fails after publishing** (for example a GitHub 500 creating the release): re-run
  the failed job. The shared workflow skips a version already on npm and a release that exists.
